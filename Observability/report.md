# Observability of bearing-only tracking via multiple sensors with bias

[@wangBearingsonlyTrackingAnalysis2010] discussed about the optimal movement of a sensor to get the most information. In the paper, the target is assumed to be static, which makes the problem easier. The main method is to find the maximum of the determinent of Fisher information matrix(FIM). The method can be refered. In my problem, a static target and four sensors are included. I have four measurements for four states(`[x, y, b1, b2]`), making the states observable. Then I calculate the FIM, then the determinent of it. To get the maximum, I need calculate the partial difference subject to headings. I think I will get two conditionals for two sensors' headings subject to each sensor's LOS, velocity and relative position. From the two I can get the headings.

But in this scenario, the FIM will become 4-order, making the calculation difficult. I don't know how to use software to get a proper solution.

Finally I got an idea. I use the substract of two measures, making the state still 2-dimentional. But the calculation is still difficult. At last, I got an implicit solution. I don't know whether this can be a result, but I don't have other methods. 

However, in two fixed sensors situation in 3-dimentional, the biases are not completely observable. This can be explained as follows: a rotation of the sensors and all the targets around the axis defined by the line connecting the optical centers of the two sensors is not observable because this will yield the same measurements regardless of the magnitude of this rotation. For moving sensors this problem is expected to go away if the sensors move sufficiently.[@belfadelBiasEstimationObservability2014]
